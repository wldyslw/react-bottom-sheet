# Usage in SSR/SSG Environments

    **TL;DR** You don't need a special treatment *to just make it work* in
    SSR/SSG environments!

Internally, Bottom Sheet uses React's [`createPortal`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal),
thus disabling ability to render server-side without a workaround.

If you don't need it anyway, then you can just drop BottomSheet into your component tree and use it rendered on client only.
Otherwise, if you strictly need to pre-render, I prepared a recipies for you.

## Rendering Without a Portal

For a number of cases, including the most straightfowrward way of getting it render server-side,
you can simply get rid of the portal by passing `standalone` prop.

```jsx
<BottomSheet standalone />
```

This way, you have to manually think of the placement of the bottom sheet keeping in mind a few moments:

-   Sheet has [`position: fixed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#fixed),
    and must be positioned relative to the initial viewport (i.e. be full-screen stretched).
    This is important as each detent, defined as percentage, is calculated relative to `window.innerHeight`.
    Feel free to fill in an issue, if you have concerns regarding this behaviour.
-   You will be in charge of assigning correct `z-index` so bottom sheet can be accessed and other `fixed` elements won't overlay it.

## Using Third-Party Solutions

If you have no choice but to keep sheet's rendering within portal, you can use third-party libraries that can insert portals server-side.
Next.js team prepared a number of great examples,
[including the very similar one](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-portals-ssr),
where they render a modal on server.

According to it, we can do the following. The `standalone` prop used here again, so you can wrap bottom sheet in a custom portal.

```jsx
import BottomSheet from '@wldyslw/react-bottom-sheet';
import { UniversalPortal } from '@jesstelford/react-portal-universal';

function App() {
    return (
        <UniversalPortal selector="body">
            <BottomSheet standalone />
        </UniversalPortal>
    );
}
```

## Dynamic Loading

There's another approach to mentioned `createPortal`'s limitation.
If it only rendered on client, why should it be even included in initial bundle?

### Next.js and `dynamic()`

You may think of something like using Next's
[`dynamic()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading#with-no-ssr)
function with `ssr: false` parameter:

```jsx
const LazySheet = dynamic(() => import('@wldyslw/react-bottom-sheet'), {
    ssr: false,
});

function App() {
    return <LazySheet />;
}
```

But it has very frustrating issue: `dynamic` will omit original `ref` handler and replace it with custom one,
so you won't be able to open sheet programmatically, for instance.
[Unfortunately, it won't be resolved](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/4957#issuecomment-413841689).

If you want to use `dynamic()` anyway, I advise you to create a wrapper around `BottomSheet` component and then use it:

```jsx filename="BottomSheetWrapper.tsx"
import { type Ref } from 'react';
import BottomSheet, {
    type BottomSheetRef,
    type BottomSheetProps,
} from '@wldyslw/react-bottom-sheet';
import '@wldyslw/react-bottom-sheet/lib/style.css';

const BottomSheetWrapper = ({
    sheetRef,
    ...props
}: BottomSheetProps & { sheetRef?: Ref<BottomSheetRef> }) => {
    return <BottomSheet {...props} ref={sheetRef} />;
};

export default BottomSheetWrapper;
```

```jsx filename="App.tsx"
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { type BottomSheetRef } from '@wldyslw/react-bottom-sheet';

const LazySheet = dynamic(() => import('./BottomSheetWrapper'), {
    ssr: false,
});

function App() {
    return <LazySheet />;
}
```

### React's `<Suspense/>` and `lazy()`

I haven't _yet_ tested it with `React.Suspense`/`React.lazy`, but hope that will do it soon!
