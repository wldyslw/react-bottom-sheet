# Contribution Guide

Monorepository that holds the package consists of package itself and docs that you're reading.
Here's described how you can deploy everything locally and start development.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="info">
    Both package and docs managed with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and it's
    [workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) feature. So first of all you should
    install it.
</Callout>

## Package

Bottom Sheet is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) so you can instantly preview results of your work in playground.
To get started, go to package folder, install deps and run dev server:

```sh
cd ./packages/react-bottom-sheet
pnpm install
pnpm dev # Congrats! You can now visit playground, usually http://localhost:5173
```

Finally, you can build component for production:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Build results located in `./package/react-bottom-sheet/lib`.

<Callout type="warning">
    Don't forget to check the build, and preview component in the docs!
    (described below)
</Callout>

## Docs

Docs are created with [Nextra](https://nextra.site), framework built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
You can read Nextra's docs in order to catch up advanced topics, but if you want to introduce minon changes you can keep reading.

As with core package, getting started is pretty trivial:

```sh
cd ./packages/docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev # http://localhost:3000 or similar should be avaliable for preview
```

Again, you can prerender docs and be sure that everything is fine:

```sh
pnpm build
```
